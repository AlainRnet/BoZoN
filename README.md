Minimalist Drag &amp; drop file sharing app

Install: just unzip on your server; no database/ php 5.2. Then go to admin.php page and create your login/pass.
config: just change globals in the core.php file.
Upload a file: go to admin.php page, connect and then drop files in the dashed area... that's it !

The share link is the file link in the admin's view.
